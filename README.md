# Illusion of Originality  
*A Case Study in Generative AI, Data Ethics, and Hidden Labor*

**Illusion of Originality** is an interactive educational website that explores how generative AI models are trained on massive scraped datasets and how this creates tension between innovation, legality, and the human labor embedded inside the data.  

The project analyzes four key actors involved in the AI data ecosystem:

- **Corporations Scraping the Internet**  
- **Governance & Regulatory Bodies**  
- **Defendants (Artists, Creators, Copyright Holders)**  
- **Whistleblowers & Consumers**

Through animated sections, actor reaction strips, and narrative storytelling, the project demonstrates how AI developers often present their models as “original,” even though they rely on billions of human produced images, texts, and artworks. This dynamic creates an **illusion of originality** while obscuring authorship, compensation, and creative ownership.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Break down how **web scraping** operates at scale and why it matters.  
- Examine the **legal gray zones** surrounding dataset creation.  
- Present a concise timeline of **copyright lawsuits** in the generative AI space.  
- Highlight conflicting incentives across the four actors.  
- Create a visually engaging, accessible way to understand big data ethics.
